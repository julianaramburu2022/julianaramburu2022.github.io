In particular, we estimate the causal effects of the regulation on workers' earnings and future employment prospects. We do so by exploiting different features specified by the policy in a regression discontinuity setting. The project circumvents prior data limitations by constructing the first large-scale administrative database containing worker-level information (from the restricted access matched employer-employee LEHD data) together with the federal contractor status of their employers (from EEOC Data and Federal Procurement Data). Motivated by our empirical findings, we develop a theoretical model in order to identify the different mechanisms through which the policy operates. Our results may suggest important margins to consider when designing policies to address racial inequalities.","tags":[],"title":"The Effect of Affirmative Action on Workers' Outcomes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["New Working Paper","June 2021 - joint with Ana Goicoechea (The World Bank) and Mushfiq Mobaraq (Yale)"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1596735329,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596735329,"objectID":"4dcacc47c6d7c7efb3622069db0e0084","permalink":"/publication/bootcamp/","publishdate":"2020-08-06T12:35:29-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/bootcamp/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper evaluates the short-term causal effects of a high-quality, intensive, part-time computer coding bootcamp for women on skill acquisition and employment outcomes. Spots were offered in an oversubscribed coding course to a random subset of applicants in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Bogota, Colombia. The applicants who were chosen received a scholarship that covered most of the tuition costs of the course. Follow-up data collected shortly after the bootcamp ended indicate that the program increased participants' coding skills, as well as their probability of finding a job in technology. Compared with other jobs, technology jobs are more likely to offer flexible hours and work-from-home arrangements, and generate higher job satisfaction. These results are interpreted as an improvement in overall job quality. Moreover, the paper compares the employment situation of the sample before and during the first months of the COVID-19 outbreak. The evidence indicates that the program increased participants' resilience to a downturn in the labor market.","tags":[],"title":"Coding Bootcamps for Female Digital Employment: Evidence from an RCT in Argentina and Colombia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L.

Exploiting arbitrary variation in the program's intervention borders, we use a geographical regression discontinuity design to identify the program's effects on agricultural outcomes. Pre-treatment balance tests show that producer and farm- level pre-treatment characteristics evolve smoothly at the intervention border. Results indicate that farmers within treated areas improved pest knowledge and are more likely to implement prevention and control practices. Also, they increased fruit production and sales. Our findings are confirmed by placebo tests and are robust to alternative regression discontinuity bandwidths and polynomials.","tags":[],"title":"Sweeping the Flies Away: Evidence from a Fruit Fly Eradication Program","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Working Paper","June 2019 - joint with Lucas Figal Garone (IADB)","Alessandro Maffioli (IADB)","Lina Salazar (IADB)","Cesar Lopez (Stanford)"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1559410445,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559410445,"objectID":"be0228593739165c11de7cc4dbda9a22","permalink":"/publication/patca/","publishdate":"2020-08-06T12:34:05-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/patca/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper estimates the impact of an agricultural technology adoption program on production and income using an experimental approach.

The assessment of indirect effects validate the hypotheses that knowledge spillovers might take place among farmers in close proximity to program beneficiaries, especially through social networks.","tags":[],"title":"Direct and Spillover Effects of Agricultural Technology Adoption Programs: Experimental Evidence from the Dominican Republic","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L.

To meet this objective, this study measures the impact of the CRIAR, an agricultural technology adoption program implemented in highly food insecure areas of rural Bolivia. The paper analyzes whether changes in food security are due to improved food availability (production and local sales) and/or greater food access (income and production used for home consumption). To this end, data from a sample of 1287 households (817 beneficiaries and 470 controls) interviewed specifically for this purpose are used. To address self-selection issues, the program's impact is estimated using an instrumental variable model. The results present evidence that program participation improved food security. Specifically, positive impacts on agricultural productivity, agricultural sales and household income are found. These findings confirm the importance of considering agricultural programs as policy tools to address food insecurity.","tags":[],"title":"Sowing for Food Security: A Case Study of Smallholder Farmers in Bolivia","type":"publication"}]
