I am an Economist II at Amazon. I obtained my Ph.D. in Economics from Yale University in May 2022.

This website is not updated frequently. For updated information on my career, CV, or publications, please visit my LinkedIn or contact me directly through email.

In my academic work, I study the effects of labor market policies on workers from underrepresented groups. In one of my projects, I analyze how the most widespread employer-based affirmative action regulation in the U.S. impacts the employment prospects and earnings of minority workers. In another project, I partner with The World Bank to implement a randomized control trial to study the effectiveness of coding bootcamps for women.  

Before joining Yale, I worked for three years as an impact evaluation consultant in the Rural Development unit at the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB).
