I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at [Yale University](https://economics.yale.edu).

In my current work, I study the effects of labor market policies on workers from underrepresented groups. In one of my projects, I analyze how the most widespread employer-based affirmative action regulation in the U.S. impacts the employment prospects and earnings of minority workers. In another project, I partner with [The World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/) to implement a randomized control trial to study the effectiveness of coding _bootcamps_ for women.  

Before joining Yale, I worked for three years as an impact evaluation consultant in the Rural Development unit at the [Inter-American Development Bank (IADB)](https://www.iadb.org/en/about-us/overview).
